Clone the repo with 'git clone REPO_HTTP_URL'

Install all the package dependencies with 'npm i'

Get a key from here, https://www.themoviedb.org/, and add it to a .env file
Use the .env.example file as a reference
Your .env should look like this:
REACT_APP_TMDB_API_KEY=API_KEY

Once dependencies have been installed and you've added your API key, you can start the app by running 'npm run start', this starts the application on your local server

If you're working on development, have the SCSS compiler running by using 'npm run compile-sass'
This compiles the SCSS you write into CSS
