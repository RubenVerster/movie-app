//placeholder image for when an image cant load
//center the movies list
//move loader when searching to next to the search bar
//add a porn filter for adult movies, make it a check in the start
//add a loading results spinner to give time to render the cards
//aaaah... need to optimize an issue where it rerenders the whole result list when you click on a movie
//maybe just refactor so there is a seperate modal component import, yeah, maybe do it XP
//add some more data into the modal, like the movie's description, rating, etc.
//footer text and icons alignment
//image optimization, some are small, search Good Will Hunting for example
//add loading state to favourite when user clicks it, prohibits spamming the favourite button :P
